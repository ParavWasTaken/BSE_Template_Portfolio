# Hand Washer Timer
The hand washer timer is a contactless timer which, when activated, times the user for 20 seconds as they wash their hands, and upon completion emits a sound to notify the user that they can stop washing their hands. It uses a SuperSonic Sensor in front of which the user places their hands to start the timer. Additionally, after the 20 seconds elapse, a buzzer will sound.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was the 4 LED’s which represented the increments of time elapsing after the sensor was activated. Additionally, the code was updated to have the sensor detect an object within the range of 1 - 50 cm in front of it. The resistors used for the LED's bottleneck the flow of the current, as only a certain amount is needed for each of them. For the next milestone, I will add the buzzer to which will make a sound when the sensor is activated.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was the sensor and buzzer, one of the most important functional components for the project, since it allows one to activate the timer, and to have it produce the sound which indicates said activation, in a contactless fashion. In the code, the SuperSonic Sensor will only detect an object in front of it from a range of 5 to 20 cm inclusive. So if one were to place an object directly in front of it, which would basically be 0 cm away, there is no detection, and likewise, if one were to go more than 20 cm away from it, there would also be no detection. Through the wiring, the code is being passed into the arduino, the arduino provides the current, the current then passes around to all of the components on the breadboard, so that both the LED and the buzzer will activate simultaneously when the sensor does. The resistor regulates the flow of the electrical current in the circuit.
