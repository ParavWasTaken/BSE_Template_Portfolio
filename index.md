# Hand Washer Timer
The hand washer timer is a contactless timer which, when activated, times the user for 20 seconds as they wash their hands, and upon completion emits a sound to notify the user that they can stop washing their hands. It uses a SuperSonic Sensor in front of which the user places their hands to start the timer. Additionally, after the 20 seconds elapse, a buzzer will sound.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was the sensor and buzzer, one of the most important functional components for the project, since it allows one to activate the timer, and to have it produce the sound which indicates said activation, in a contactless fashion. In the code, the SuperSonic Sensor will only detect an object in front of it from a range of 5 to 20 cm inclusive. So if one were to place an object directly in front of it, which would basically be 0 cm away, there is no detection, and likewise, if one were to go more than 20 cm away from it, there would also be no detection. Through the wiring, the code is being passed into the arduino, the arduino provides the current, the current then passes around to all of the components on the breadboard, so that both the LED and the buzzer will activate simultaneously when the sensor does. The resistor regulates the flow of the electrical current in the circuit.
